What we need to implement
 * useful and configurable output format of object details
 * ways to alter object's name and source
 * implement extended attributes - for example, 'author'.
 * set arithmetics ("give me all objects that are contained in tags a AND b", etc)
 * support for URLs
 * attaches - objects that are "childs of" or "supplement" some object. These objects can be tagged, but not always will.
